            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

            Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
          learning from their experiences was easy.

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

          “Before joining the bootcamp,I've never written a line of code. 
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming
          step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can
          only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not
          disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
          agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
          level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
          during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job
          as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
